            I’ve been working at <span className="highlight">Copart</span> for the past
            <span className="highlight"> 1 year 9 months</span>, mostly building cool stuff with
            <span className="highlight"> React</span> and <span className="highlight">Spring</span>.
            I occasionally dip my toes into mobile app development too — just enough to keep things spicy.

            When I’m not coding, I’m probably lifting weights, learning how to not drown (a.k.a. swimming),
            or chasing a better 5K time. I love music, deep YouTube documentaries, and those random videos
            that somehow end up teaching you something you never searched for.

            This website is my little corner of the internet — where I post things I enjoy, discover, or build.
            No promises, no themes — just vibes and curiosity.
